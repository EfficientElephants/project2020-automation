#####  Routing traffic through your local machine
- Set tunnel value to `true` in test capabilities
> OS specific instructions to download and setup tunnel binary can be found at the following links.
>    - [Windows](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+Windows)
>    - [Mac](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+MacOS)
>    - [Linux](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+Linux)

### Important Note:
Some Safari & IE browsers, doesn't support automatic resolution of the URL string "localhost". Therefore if you test on URLs like "http://localhost/" or "http://localhost:8080" etc, you would get an error in these browsers. A possible solution is to use "localhost.lambdatest.com" or replace the string "localhost" with machine IP address. For example if you wanted to test "http://localhost/dashboard" or, and your machine IP is 192.168.2.6 you can instead test on "http://192.168.2.6/dashboard" or "http://localhost.lambdatest.com/dashboard".
